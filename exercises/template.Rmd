The purpose of this document is to provide a template for making your own
exercises in this project. Ideally, you should be able to copy this file

# The model

This section introduces the model. You can use $/LaTeX/ to represent
equations on there own line:
$$equation goes here$$
Or you can mention some $math$ in line.

# The data

This is an optional section that can be used to describe the
data. You may want to make a simple table in markdown style:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Alternatively, you can display a data table using knitr's
`kable` function.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5, ], caption = "A knitr kable.")
```

Discussing data and/or including tables is probably not needed for most
exercises, but may be useful for explaining novel data types (e.g. spatial
capture-recapture data).
