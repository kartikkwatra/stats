## Exercises in model fitting for grad students

These assignments are meant for new graduate students in [my
lab](http://chandlerlab.uga.edu/). They assume that students have some
basic familiarity with statistical inference, but most students will
need help getting through the first few exercises before they are
comfortable with the process of writing likelihood equations and joint
posterior distributions.

The recommended way **to view the exercises** is to compile the .tex
files with `pdflatex` or the .Rmd files with `rmarkdown`. However,
there will also be a .md file that can be viewed directly in github. I
recommend that you view the .md files in Chrome with the 'GitHub with
MathJax' extension enabled so that you can read the equations. 

Most keys will not be available. **To view the keys** that are
available (eg, the lm key), you can create a PDF by running 'knitr' on
the .Rnw file. See the stats/keys/lm/lm-build.R file for
examples. There will also be a markdown file, but the equations may
not be rendered correctly.

There are likely to be mistakes in these exercises. Feel free to let
me know if you find any, and I will try to correct them.
