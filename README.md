Exercises in model fitting for grad students

These assignments are meant for new graduate students in [my
lab](http://chandlerlab.uga.edu/). They assume that students have some
basic familiarity with statistical inference, but most students will
need help getting through the first few exercises before they are
comfortable with the process of writing likelihood equations and joint
posterior distributions.  

There are likely to be mistakes in these exercises. Feel free to let
me know if you find any, and I will try to correct them.
