title: Exercises in model fitting for grad students
---

## Overview

This site is a work in progress. The plan is to create a series of
exercises that demonstrate how to fit several classes of statistical
models that are regularly used in population ecology. At the end of
each exercise will be an assignment. The keys to most assignments will
not be made publically available, but can be requested. 

The purpose of this is to help my students learn some basic model
fitting skills. Hopefully these materials will help others too, but I
don't plan on providing much support for anyone other than my
students. 



### Exercises

Hopefully there will be many more coming soon.
