title: Exercises in model fitting for grad students
---

## Overview

I've just gotten underway with this site, but the plan is to create a
series of exercises that demonstrate how to fit several classes of
statistical models that are regularly used in population ecology. At
the end of each exercise will be an assignment. The keys to most
assignments will not be made publically available, but can be
requested.

The purpose of this site is to help my graduate students learn the basics
of fitting statistical models to ecological data. Hopefully these
materials will help others too, but I don't plan on providing much
support for anyone other than my students. 



### Exercises

More coming soon.

[Linear models](exercises/lm/include-lm.md)



### Keys

Most keys won't be available, but here is one provided as an example:

[Linear models](keys/lm/include-lm-key.md}





### Caution

This site is a work in progress. It's the front-end to the source code
[here](https://github.com/rbchan/stats). Let me know if you find
mistakes or if you want to contribute.
